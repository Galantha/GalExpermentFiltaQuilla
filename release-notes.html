<strong>Support My Work</strong>

As I am often asked about added features for filter conditions and actions for my Add-on <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quickfilters/">quickFilters</a> - FiltaQuilla is a better location for extending Filter behavior - specifically adding new types of Actions and Conditions.
