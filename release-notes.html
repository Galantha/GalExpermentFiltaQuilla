<b>Version 3.4</b>

FiltaQuilla is now compatible with Thunderbird 91. FiltaQuilla had to have some necessary changes for Thunderbird 91, for instance the filteraction "match" function has been replace with "matchAction" and changed parameters.

I will try to keep the latest version on ATN compatible with both Thunderbird 78 and ESR 91 as long as possible.
